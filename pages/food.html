        Green Tea Lava Cake <p></p>
        This dessert consists of a green tea flavored molten lava cake accompanied by a scoop of tofu
        flavored ice cream. Both items are delicious. When you cut open the lava cake, green tea flavored
        filling would ooze out and you are supposed to quickly scoope the outer cake with the filling and
        eat them together. The tofu ice cream is also very interesting. It tastes like frozen soy milk.

        Cream Mochi <p></p>
        This dessert consists of sweet glutenous rice outer wrap with cream filling inside. I enjoyed the
        dish even though it felt a bit unhealthy as I was eating it.

        Chicken Stew <p></p>
        This is a dish from a Portugese restaurant. The chicken tasted tender and the creamy white sauce
        complimented the meat very well. The leftover sauce can also be added to white rice and the sauce
        tastes very rich and delicious.
