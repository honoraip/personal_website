        Ming Tomb <p></p>
        This picture was taken at the Ming Tombs near Beijing. It is a huge park built in the Ming Dynasty
        with emperors' tombs around it. I really enjoyed the view and it reminded me of a scene from the
        anime movie called Spirited Away. It was nice and quiet, and you can even take pictures with the
        statues along the pathway.

        The House of Dancing Water <p></p>
        This picture is a scene from a circus show called The House of Dancing Water. The show featured dance
        and circus moves, as well as special water effects on stage. Some of the moves even incorporated
        movements underwater. It was worth watching since it was such a grand production.

        Atami Seaside <p></p>
        This place is called Atami and it is a small city near Tokyo famous for its hot springs. As you can
        see from the picture, the city is right next to the ocean. It is definitely a pleasant place. I visited
        there over the summer and it was very comfortable walking by the seaside with wind blowing.
